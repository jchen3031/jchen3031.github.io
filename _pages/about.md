## About Me

Hello! I'm Jingyuan (Steven) Chen, a motivated learner and practitioner passionate about data analytics and software engineering.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a Minor in Computer Science (Intelligence Track) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Prior to that, I earned an Associate of Arts in Computer Science from Tacoma Community College.

My technical skills are centered around Python and Java, and I am proficient with libraries essential for data science and machine learning, including NumPy, Pandas, Tensorflow, Pytorch, and scikit-learn. I have a strong interest in machine learning, neural networks, data analysis, and algorithm design.

During my studies, I engaged in several projects, such as:
* Leading a team to explore the use of multilayer and convolutional neural networks for classifying handwritten digits, characters, and flower datasets.
* Building neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras to classify yoga poses.
* Conducting an individual project analyzing chest X-ray images using neural networks to predict pneumonia.

I am currently based at Syracuse University in NY, US, and I am eager to take on future challenges, applying my knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems.

Feel free to connect with me via the contact information available on my profile!
