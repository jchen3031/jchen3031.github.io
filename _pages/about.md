## About Me

Hello! I'm Jingyuan (Steven) Chen[cite: 1], a motivated learner and practitioner passionate about data analytics and software engineering[cite: 1].

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a Minor in Computer Science (Intelligence Track) from the Georgia Institute of Technology[cite: 2]. Prior to that, I earned an Associate of Arts in Computer Science from Tacoma Community College.

My technical skills are centered around Python and Java[cite: 1], and I am proficient with libraries essential for data science and machine learning, including NumPy, Pandas, Tensorflow, Pytorch, and scikit-learn. I have a strong interest in machine learning[cite: 4, 6], neural networks[cite: 3, 5, 7], data analysis, and algorithm design.

During my studies, I engaged in several projects, such as:
* Leading a team to explore the use of multilayer and convolutional neural networks for classifying handwritten digits, characters, and flower datasets[cite: 4, 5].
* Building neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras to classify yoga poses[cite: 7].
* Conducting an individual project analyzing chest X-ray images using neural networks to predict pneumonia[cite: 3].

I am currently based at Syracuse University in NY, US, and I am eager to take on future challenges[cite: 2], applying my knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems.
